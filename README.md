# Investigate-a-Dataset

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil, with a primary focus on determining whether patients attend their scheduled appointments or not. It also contains various characteristics related to the patients who have made these appointments. Our goal is to analyze this dataset in order to answer specific questions and identify factors that may influence attendance at these appointments. By examining the data, we aim to gain insights into the patterns and correlations that can help us better understand patient behavior and appointment attendance.

The dataset consists of several columns, each representing different variables or attributes. 
        
PatientId ,AppointmentID, Gender ,ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay ,Age ,Neighbourhood,Scholarship  ,Hipertension,Diabetes	,Alcoholism	,Handcap ,SMS_received ,No-show	        

1-Is there a correlation between gender and no-shows for appointments?

2-Which age group has a higher number of no-shows for appointments?

3-Is there a correlation between having a handicap and not showing up for appointments?

4- Does receiving SMS increase the chances of show-up?
