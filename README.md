# Investigate-a-Dataset

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil, with a primary focus on determining whether patients attend their scheduled appointments or not. It also contains various characteristics related to the patients who have made these appointments. Our goal is to analyze this dataset in order to answer specific questions and identify factors that may influence attendance at these appointments. By examining the data, we aim to gain insights into the patterns and correlations that can help us better understand patient behavior and appointment attendance.
